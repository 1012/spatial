Neo4j Spatial

    Neo4j Spatial is a library of utilities for Neo4j that faciliates the enabling of spatial operations on data.
    In particular you can add spatial indexes to already located data, and perform spatial operations on the data like searching for data within specified regions or within a specified distance of a point of interest.
    In addition classes are provided to expose the data to geotools and thereby to geotools enabled applications like geoserver and uDig.
