Index and Querying
==================

The current index is an RTree index, but it has been developed in an extensible way allowing for other indices to be added if necessary.
The spatial queries implemented are:

* Contain
* Cover
* Covered By
* Cross
* Disjoint
* Intersect
* Intersect Window
* Overlap
* Touch
* Within
* Within Distance
