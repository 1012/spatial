Examples
========

[[spatial-import-shapefile]]
== Importing a shapefile ==

Spatial data is divided in Layers and indexed by a RTree.

    GraphDatabaseService database = new EmbeddedGraphDatabase(storeDir);
	try {
		ShapefileImporter importer = new ShapefileImporter(database);
	    importer.importShapefile("roads.shp", "layer_roads");
	} finally {
		database.shutdown();
	}

[[spatial-import-osm]]
== Importing an Open Street Map file ==


This is more complex because the current OSMImporter class runs in two phases, the first requiring a batch-inserter on the database.
The is ongoing work to allow for a non-batch-inserter on the entire process, and possibly when you have read this that will already be available.
Refer to the unit tests in classes +TestDynamicLayers+ and +TestOSMImport+ for the latest code for importing OSM data. For example:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-spatial
source=org/neo4j/gis/spatial/TestsForDocs.java
tag=importOsm
----

This code will import the map.osm Open Street Map file, populating the database with a little over 200 geometries, including streets, buildings and points of interest.

[[spatial-spatial-query]]
== Executing a spatial query ==

Assuming you imported the map.osm file as in the previous example, you can now perform spatial searches on the data. The following example will search within a rectangle for a whatever geometries it can find:

[snippet,java]
----
component=neo4j-spatial
source=org/neo4j/gis/spatial/TestsForDocs.java
tag=searchBBox
----

For more examples of query code, refer to the test code in the +LayerTest+ and the +SpatialTest+ classes.
Also review the classes in the +org.neo4j.gis.spatial.query package+ for the full range or search queries currently implemented.
